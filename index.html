From Spain to Morocco, Greece, Turkey, Israel, South America, Mexico, Cuba and the United States, the dispersion of Sephardic Jewry led to a far-reaching exchange of customs and ideas. This year, as the shofar is blown to gather people together, we strive to promote global awareness of the shared customs and traditions of these diverse Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities.
